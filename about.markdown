# Welcome to My Blog

Hello! I'm Daniel Kliewer, a web developer with a passion for machine learning. 
This blog is where I share my thoughts, experiences, and discoveries in the world of technology.

## About Me

I have always lived in Central Texas. I began programming the summer I took Pre-Cal in middle school on a TI-83 and made my own version of Snake. I never made much progress until LLMs have accelerated my study of programming.
