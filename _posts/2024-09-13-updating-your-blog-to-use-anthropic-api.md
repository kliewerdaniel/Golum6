## Advantages of the Anthropic API

2. **Enhanced User Interaction**: Deliver engaging, contextually appropriate responses with AI.
3. **Increased Efficiency**: Automate repetitive content tasks to save time and effort.

## Integration Guide for the Anthropic API

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- A registered account with Anthropic
- Your API keys for authentication
- Basic understanding of Jekyll and Liquid tags

### Step 1: Install Necessary Gems

Add these gems to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'httparty'   # To handle HTTP requests
gem 'json'       # To parse JSON responses
```

Run `bundle install` to add the gems to your project.

### Step 2: Create a Jekyll Plugin

In the `_plugins` directory of your Jekyll site, create a file named `ai_search_tag.rb` with the following content:

```ruby
# _plugins/ai_search_tag.rb
require 'httparty'
require 'json'

module Jekyll
  class AISearch < Liquid::Tag
    def initialize(tag_name, text, tokens)
      super
      @text = text.strip
    end

    def render(context)
      api_key = ENV['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY']
      response = HTTParty.post("https://api.anthropic.com/v1/generate", 
                               body: { prompt: @text }.to_json,
                               headers: { "Authorization" => "Bearer #{api_key}", 
                                          "Content-Type" => "application/json" })
      result = JSON.parse(response.body)
      result["text"]
    end
  end
end



### Step 3: Use the New Tag in Your Posts

To use the tag in your posts, simply include it in your Markdown files like this:

## Example Usage

Here’s how to use the Anthropic API in a blog post:

{% ai_search "Generate a summary of Jekyll blog post integration" %}

### Step 4: Configure Your Environment Variables

Set the environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` with your API key. Make sure to keep this key secure and avoid hardcoding it into your project files.

## Conclusion

Integrating the Anthropic API into your Jekyll blog can greatly enhance your content management and creation process. By following these instructions, you’ll be able to use AI to produce engaging and relevant content efficiently.
