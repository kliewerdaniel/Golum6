---

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kliewerdaniel/golum2.git
```

The repository contains `golum.sh`, a script to set up the blog.

### Beginning of `golum.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Jekyll Blog Setup Script

set -e
echo "Setting up your Jekyll blog with headless CMS, Docker, and Netlify..."

# Step 1: Create a new Jekyll site
jekyll new golum3
cd golum3

# Step 2: Set up Git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Step 3: Create Dockerfile
cat << EOF > Dockerfile
FROM jekyll/jekyll:4.2.0
WORKDIR /srv/jekyll
COPY . .
RUN bundle install
CMD ["jekyll", "serve", "--force_polling", "-H", "0.0.0.0"]
EOF

# Step 4: Create docker-compose.yml
cat << EOF > docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  site:
    command: jekyll serve --force_polling
    image: jekyll/jekyll:4.2.0
    volumes:
      - .:/srv/jekyll
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
EOF

# Step 5: Set up Netlify CMS
mkdir -p admin
cat << EOF > admin/config.yml
backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: main
media_folder: "assets/uploads"
collections:
  - name: "blog"
    label: "Blog"
    folder: "_posts"
    create: true
    slug: "{{year}}-{{month}}-{{day}}-{{slug}}"
    fields:
      - {label: "Layout", name: "layout", widget: "hidden", default: "post"}
      - {label: "Title", name: "title", widget: "string"}
      - {label: "Publish Date", name: "date", widget: "datetime"}
      - {label: "Body", name: "body", widget: "markdown"}
EOF

cat << EOF > admin/index.html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Content Manager</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
EOF
```

---

## Running the Setup Script

After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory and make the script executable:

```bash
cd golum3
chmod +x golum.sh
./golum.sh
```

### The Script Will:

1. Create a new Jekyll site
2. Set up Git
3. Create a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
4. Set up Netlify CMS
5. Build and run the Docker container
6. Initialize Netlify
7. Push your code to GitHub

---

## Next Steps

Once the setup is complete, you can:

- Visit `http://localhost:4000` to view your blog locally.
- Use the Netlify CMS at `http://localhost:4000/admin` to manage content.
- Commit and push changes to GitHub to trigger deployment on Netlify.

### Project Structure After Setup

```bash
my-blog/
├── _posts/
├── _site/
├── admin/
│   ├── config.yml
│   └── index.html
├── assets/
│   └── uploads/
├── _config.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Gemfile
├── Gemfile.lock
└── .ruby-version
```

---

## Customization

- Modify `_config.yml` for basic settings.
- Edit or add templates in the `_layouts` and `_includes` directories.
- Customize styles in the `assets/css` directory.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all prerequisites are correctly installed.
- Confirm the local Ruby version matches `.ruby-version` (3.0.0).
- Verify the Bundler version is compatible with Ruby 3.0.0.

---

## Deployment

1. Push changes to your GitHub repository.
2. Netlify will automatically detect changes and trigger a new build.
3. Once the build is complete, Netlify will deploy your site.

---

## Writing Blog Posts

You can create blog posts using the Netlify CMS or manually in the `_posts` directory.

### Manual Post Example

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT
categories: [category1, category2]
---
Your post content in Markdown goes here.
```

---

## Comments

### Critical Thinker
As a Critical Thinker, I'll analyze this post with skepticism and consider various assumptions.

**Initial Observations**

1. The post is an extensive guide on setting up a Jekyll blog using Netlify CMS, Docker, and Netlify for deployment.
2. It covers prerequisites, installation steps, getting started, and troubleshooting sections, which indicates a comprehensive approach to setup.

**Concerns and Questions**

1. **Complexity**: The guide assumes readers are familiar with command-line interfaces (CLI), Docker, and Jekyll concepts. Will beginners find it too overwhelming?
2. **Prerequisites**: Are all the listed prerequisites necessary for a basic Jekyll blog? Can some be skipped or substituted with alternatives?
3. **Version Compatibility**: The post specifies Ruby 3.0.0 as a prerequisite. What if the user has an older version of Ruby installed? Will it still work?
4. **Troubleshooting**: While the guide provides troubleshooting steps, are they exhaustive enough to cover all possible issues that might arise during setup?
5. **Assumptions about reader's environment**: The post assumes readers have a Linux-based system (e.g., Ubuntu). What if users have Windows or macOS? Will the instructions still work?

**Potential Biases and Assumptions**

1. **Assuming familiarity with technology**: The guide seems to assume readers are already familiar with technologies like Docker, Jekyll, and Netlify CMS.
2. **Promoting specific tools**: By using specific tools (e.g., Netlify CMS), the post might be promoting those tools over others, potentially creating a bias towards them.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Simplify prerequisites**: Consider breaking down the prerequisites into smaller, more manageable chunks to make it easier for beginners to follow.
2. **Provide alternatives**: Offer alternative solutions or substitutions for users who may not meet all the prerequisites (e.g., using older versions of Ruby).
3. **Enhance troubleshooting section**: Add more detailed and specific troubleshooting steps to help users overcome common issues.
4. **Consider cross-platform compatibility**: Modify instructions to work on multiple operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) or provide separate guides for each platform.

**Conclusion**

While the post provides a comprehensive guide to setting up a Jekyll blog with Netlify CMS, Docker, and Netlify deployment, it assumes familiarity with specific technologies and might be biased towards certain tools. By considering these concerns and suggestions for improvement, the author can create an even more user-friendly and inclusive resource for beginners and experienced users alike.

### Devil's Advocate
**Potential Issues and Concerns with this Guide**

While this guide provides a comprehensive step-by-step instructions for setting up a Jekyll blog using Netlify CMS, Docker, and Netlify for deployment, there are some potential issues and concerns that might arise:

1. **Complexity**: The setup process involves multiple tools (Git, Docker, Ruby, Bundler, Jekyll, Node.js, npm, Netlify CLI), which can be overwhelming for beginners.
2. **Version Compatibility Issues**: With the use of specific versions of various tools (e.g., Ruby 3.0.0, Jekyll 4.2.0), there might be compatibility issues if users are not careful about updating their environment.
3. **Error Handling**: The guide assumes a smooth setup process, but what happens when errors occur during the installation or deployment? Are there clear instructions on how to troubleshoot and resolve issues?
4. **Security Considerations**: Using Netlify CMS for content management involves storing sensitive data (e.g., API tokens). How does this guide ensure users understand the security implications of their setup?
5. **Project Structure Overload**: The sample project structure provided at the end might be overwhelming, especially for those new to Jekyll and Ruby.
6. **Customization Limitations**: While there are instructions on how to customize templates, layouts, and styles, are there any limitations or gotchas users should be aware of?
7. **Deployment Issues**: What happens if users encounter deployment issues with Netlify? Are there clear instructions on how to troubleshoot and resolve these problems?

**Recommendations for Improvements**

To address the concerns mentioned above, I would suggest:

1. Providing a more detailed error handling section.
2. Including clear security guidelines and best practices for using Netlify CMS.
3. Offering recommendations for simplifying the project structure or providing alternative setups.
4. Adding additional resources or tutorials on how to customize templates, layouts, and styles without overloading users with too much information.
5. Expanding the deployment section to cover potential issues that might arise during the deployment process.

By addressing these concerns and incorporating these improvements, this guide can become even more comprehensive and user-friendly for those attempting to set up a Jekyll blog using Netlify CMS, Docker, and Netlify for deployment.
